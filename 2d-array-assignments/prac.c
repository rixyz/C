// Write a Guess the Number game that has three levels of difficulty. The first
// level of difficulty would be a number between 1 and 10. The second difficulty
// set would be between 1 and 100. The third difficulty set would be between 1
// and 1000. Prompt for the difficulty level, and then start the game. The
// computer picks a random numberin thatrange and prompts the player to guess
// that number. Each time the player guesses, the computer should give the
// player a hint as to whether the number is too high or too low. The computer
// should also keep track of the number of guesses. Once the player guesses the
// correct number, the computer should present the number of guesses and ask if
// the player would like to play again.
