// Write a program that generates a random numberbetween 1 and 20and asks the
// user to guess what the number is. If the user's guess is higher than the
// random number, the program should display "Too high, try again." If the
// user's guess is lower than the random number, the program should display "Too
// low, try again." The program should use a loop that repeats until the user
// correctly guesses the random number.Display score after user enters correct
// number.Total score is 20.And score deduced by one each time user enter wrong
// guess.
